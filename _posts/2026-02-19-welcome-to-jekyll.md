You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes.

To add new posts, create a new file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
